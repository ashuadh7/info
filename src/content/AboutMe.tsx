const aboutMe = `
Hi, I'm **Ashu**, a developer and researcher specializing in **virtual reality (VR)**. My work focuses on designing **intuitive, embodied interactions** that enhance user experience and immersion in digital environments.

## What I Do
- **VR Interaction & UI/UX Design** – Exploring and refining how people interact with virtual environments to improve usability and engagement.
- **Immersive Experience Development** – Independently building interactive applications in Unity and Unreal Engine, from coding to basic asset creation.
- **Research & Prototyping** – Experienced in every stage of the research process, including literature review, study design, software development, user studies, data analysis, and writing findings. I collaborate with teams by bringing both technical and research expertise to every project.
- **Data Visualization & Analysis** – Transforming complex data into clear, intuitive visuals that make insights accessible to collaborators outside the field.

## Background & Experience
I hold a **Master’s degree in Interactive Arts and Technology** from Simon Fraser University and a **Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering** from Tribhuvan University. My master’s thesis focused on **VR locomotion techniques** to address spatial disorientation and motion sickness.

I have collaborated with researchers, developers, and designers on projects ranging from **emotion regulation in VR** to **biofeedback-driven meditation experiences**. I have also taught **advanced game design and UI/UX principles** as a lecturer in computer science and contributed to industry projects that integrate immersive technologies into interactive applications.

## What I'm Working On
I am currently **starting my PhD**, focusing on **embodied interactions for VR**. My research aims to push the boundaries of interaction design in virtual environments, making them more natural, accessible, and engaging.

## Let’s Connect!
I am always open to collaborations, discussions on VR and HCI, and new opportunities. Feel free to reach out!
